The **epiGenomic Efficient Correlator** tool is designed to efficiently perform pairwise pearson correlations(spearman coming soon) of thousands of epigenomic datasets. It supports both bigWig and bedGraph formats(WIG coming soon) and offers the possibility to compute correlations at any resolution(1kb to 1mb is prefered for human genome) on costum or predefined filtered regions, as well as the annotation and analysis of the generated correlation matrices.
    
A galaxy implementation including thousands of pre-computed public datasets is availalble at http://epigeec.genap.ca/galaxy/ and already includes support for the WIG format and spearman correlation
